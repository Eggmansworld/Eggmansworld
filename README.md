# Digital preservation, arcade archaeology, and unapologetically large collections.

This account exists to **document, verify, and preserve** game software, data, and hardware ecosystems that are actively disappearing — especially arcade, PC-based arcade, and hybrid platforms that never had a clean consumer afterlife.

## What lives here

- 🗃️ **Datfiles & fixdats**  
  XML/DAT ecosystems built for accuracy, auditability, and long-term maintenance.

- 🕹️ **Arcade & PC-arcade preservation**  
  Raw Thrills, Namco ES*, Taito Type X, Sega ALLS, Neowiz MUCA, LaserDisc systems, and other “it ran on a PC, but not *your* PC” platforms.

- 🛠️ **Tooling & automation**  
  Python, PowerShell, and batch utilities for validation, normalization, hashing, and large-scale curation.

- 📚 **Hardware notes & forensics**  
  Board IDs, storage formats, version strings, quirks, and the weird details that vanish first.

## Philosophy

- Accuracy beats convenience  
- Reproducibility beats aesthetics  
- Nothing is “known” unless it’s verified  
- Silent modifications are preservation failure  

If a file changes, it’s documented.  
If a version exists, it’s tracked.  
If something is uncertain, it’s labeled as such.

## Where to start

Pinned repositories highlight:
- Primary datfile projects
- Active preservation efforts
- Supporting tools and documentation

Each repository contains its own README with scope, structure, and usage notes.

## Community

This work builds on decades of operators, developers, collectors, and preservationists.
Credit is intentional. Attribution matters.

If you know something that isn’t written down yet, it probably belongs here.

## Support

If these tools, dats, or archives save you time, consider supporting the work:
